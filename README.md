# Lean's gameOfLife
Yet another game of life written in javascript (ES6) using canvas.

The funny thing about this version of the game is that it allows you to change Conway's rules. 
For example, when the game converges to a steady state you can modify any of the rules to make it start changing again, and then go back to Conway's rules. Very interesting things may happen when you change the rules.
